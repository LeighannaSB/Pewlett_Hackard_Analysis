## Summary

The analysis found that 90,398 Pewlett Hackard Employees will be eligible for retirement during the upcoming "silver tsunami"- this means they will have over 90,000 positions to fill as a result. The company may need to look into revising the requirements for their mentorship program as the analysis revealed they will not have near the number of eligible employees needed to mentor the volume of new employees that will be hired to fill the positions left by the retiring employees. For example 4,502 Technique Leader positions will need to be filled by new hires but only 99 current employees holding the Technique Leader position are eligible for the mentorship program.
